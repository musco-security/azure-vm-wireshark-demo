# azure-vm-wireshark-demo

This project demonstrates how to use Microsoft Azure to create and configure two virtual machines (VMs) for network packet capture using Wireshark. One VM acts as the monitoring station with Wireshark installed, and the other is used to simulate traffic for analysis.

## üîß What This Project Covers

- Provisioning two Azure virtual machines
- Setting up network rules and connectivity between the VMs
- Installing Wireshark on one VM
- Capturing and analyzing packets between the two VMs

## üì¶ Tools and Services Used

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines, Resource Groups, Network Security Groups)
- Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
- Wireshark
- Windows Server or Ubuntu (depending on your VM OS choice)

## ‚úÖ Learning Objectives

- Understand how to set up networked VMs in Azure
- Learn basic packet capture techniques with Wireshark
- Explore network communication and troubleshooting in a cloud environment

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Create a new Azure resource group.
2. Deploy two VMs in the same virtual network.
3. Open necessary ports (RDP, ICMP, etc.) via Network Security Groups.
4. Install Wireshark on one VM.
5. Use the second VM to send pings or HTTP traffic.
6. Capture traffic on the first VM using Wireshark.

Next we need to create a resource group to create our virtual machines in

Click the resource group link, and type in what the name you want to call the resource group and what subscription you're attaching it to, and lastly the region that you want to store it in

Next click on the review and create tab to process the resource group to complete it

After completing the request to have your resource group created, then go back to the resource group tab to make sure it is showing up. If not, just refresh your page to see it

Next, I clicked on virtual machines and then create so we can start the process for creating our windows virtual machine

Choose the subscription and resource group that we created and I chose to name the first virtual machine "windowsvm" and select the same region that we chose for the resource group

The main thing in this screenshot; we selected the windows 10 Pro image for this vm and selected the available zones

Click next, we chose image default OS disk size, and we chose Premium SSD for local redundant storage

Here we went to the next tab to set up the networking details. I named the virtual network chose the subnet for this VM, then I chose to allow selected ports for this lab like RDP 3389

After clicking review and create, wait for the validation pass and then click create to submit it for processing which should take a few minutes

I created a budget to keep track of the expense that the resource group grows monthly throughout the next two years

_Add screenshots of your VM setup and Wireshark captures here._

## üß† Notes

- Ensure both VMs are in the same virtual network for packet visibility.
- You may need to run Wireshark as administrator to see all interfaces.
- Keep security in mind when exposing ports.
